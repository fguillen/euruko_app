SimpleTextFields
==================

This plugin will remove tags from your models' string and text fields.
This is thought for those parts of your model where you expect text without tags,
in stead of striping the tags in the views, as is commonly done, you can use this
plugin without being afraid of forgetting the 'h' in <%= h @post.title %>, just
use <%= @post.title %>

simple_text_fields can receive two options. Usage is as follows:

 - simple_text_fields
   will strip tags from all the string and text fields.

 - simple_text_fields :only => :title
   will strip tags only in title.
   
   simple_text_fields :only => [:title, :brief]
   will strip tags only in title and brief.
   
 - simple_text_fields :except => :title
   will strip tags from all the fields except title.

 - simple_text_fields :except => [:title, :brief]
   will strip tags from all the fields except title and brief.
   
Every useful bit included in this plugin has been coded by Ernesto Jimenez, extraordinaire spanish hacker.
His original plugin has been perverted by Raul Murciano, trying to use the nice HTML Sanitizers included on Rails by the always brilliant Rick Olson.
